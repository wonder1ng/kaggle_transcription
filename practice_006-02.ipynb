    "# Preface\n",
    "This notebooks aims to build a light-weight CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses specgrams of resampled wav files(rate 8000) as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to Kaggle cloud hardware limitations, this script is a 'crippled' version of the original one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get LB 0.74, you need to set epoch to 5, set chop_audio(num=1000) and double all Conv layer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this script is a slight imrpovement over Alex Ozerin's baseline, I believe by using original wav files(16000 sample rate) one can achieve higher scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "# File Structure\n",
    "This script assumes data are stored in following strcuture:\n",

    "\n",

    "# Improve This Script\n",
    "Since this is only a light-weight CNN, it's performance is limited. Here are some ways to improve it's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use original wav files instead resampled ones.\n",
    "2. Create more 'silence' wav files using chop_audio.\n",
    "3. Build deeper CNN or use RNN.\n",
    "4. Train for longer epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "# After Words\n",
    "It's still a long way to reach LB 0.88.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I doubt CNN would ever reach that high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to share your ideas in the comment sections about using CNN to label wav files :)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Appendix\n",
    "Thanks **DavidS** and **Alex Ozerin** for their great notebooks!"
